The trucks primary weakness is in the low number of configurations offered, although this strategy makes sense given the Tundra minuscule relative sales numbers versus the segment leaders. Against the flood of different ways one can order an American truck, the Tundra offers a regular cab, a Double Cab extended cab, and a Crewmax four-full-door variant, each with a fixed bed choice except for the lower-grade Double Cabs, which are available in 6.6- and 8.1-foot lengths. The CrewMax can be paired only with the 5.6-foot bed, while the regular cab is long-bed only.

The C rides on a shorter wheelbase than the regular Prius, and the C combined horsepower, at 99, is less than the 134 hp of the Prius. The EPA rates the C at the same 50 mpg combined as the bigger Prius, but coaxing that level of fuel economy will drain all driving pleasure from the equation.",
        "DetailContent" : "What New: Like its Yaris platform-mate, the Prius C cosmetics have had some attention for 2015, most notably a new grille reminiscent of the restyled Camry sedan. The freshened fascia sports LED projector-beam headlights, and LED lights have also been added at the rear. Upgraded materials improve the interior appearance, but perhaps the most compelling element of this freshening is the addition of three hot bright colors. Electric Lime Metallic (shown on this test car) may suggest the presence of performance that the Prius C simply does not possess, but its shimmering iridescence adds an element of visual fun."

        "Content" : "Fans of efficient driving now have another option: the Prius Prime plug-in hybrid. Electric motors and a four-cylinder gas engine team with a larger battery than the regular Prius, yielding up to 25 miles of electric-only range; its 124 MPGe rating beats the Chevy Volt 106 MPGe. An 11.6-inch touchscreen infotainment system is standard. Behind the wheel, the Prius Prime feels quite nimble, smoothly taking curves; its ride is compliant, too, and its steering is among the best, hybrid or not.",
        "DetailContent" : "Against expectations, Toyota has made a decent business out of the Prius, a car whose picture should appear in the dictionary next to the word frump. Assuming the market doesnot collapse by the end of the year, Toyota will sell well over 100,000 vehicles wearing the nameplate in 2016, a figure that is split among three models: the entry-level Prius C; the wagonoid Prius V; and the wavy-whacky new Prius, redesigned just last year by people obviously on psychotropic drugs. Henceforth, beginning with the 2017 model, Toyota is calling last year new Prius the Prius liftback. Why the name change? To make room for yet another Prius family member, the Prius Prime, essentially the plug-in version of the Prius liftback that, ahem, also has a hatchback."

With the rear seats folded, it offers 67 cubic feet of cargo space-more than some SUVs. Drive it with the lightest of right feet and you might see as much as 44 mpg in the city. The downside: The Prius V lacks any semblance of driving dynamics. Instead, they are replaced with the sleep-inducing attributes you might expect from such an appliance.",
        "DetailContent" : "The Prius V is the big-and-tall Toyota Prius, the one with a huge back seat and 34 cubic feet of cargo space (67 cubic feet with the rear seat folded). And, try as we might, we canot get it to fit into any particular segment. It not a conventional wagon, crossover, or minivan, but it does combine elements of all of those vehicle types."

        "Content" : "C-HR stands for Coupe High-Rider, despite this little utes having four doors and riding rather low for a crossover. A turbo 2.0-liter four pumps out 144 hp and teams with a CVT. Oddly, the C-HR is front-drive only; all-wheel drive is not an option. Safety tech includes a forward-collision warning system with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning with steering assist, automatic high beams, and adaptive cruise control. Look for the C-HR in spring 2017.",
        "DetailContent" : "With the Scion brand consigned to the dustbin, Toyota slid its new, Scion-intended C-HR small crossover into its mainstream lineup. Of course, the C-HR was always planned to sell as a Toyota in other markets, such as Europe (where that market production version was shown in Geneva early this year). Look, just because the lifted-coupe thing has not been cool to us since Eagle was an American Motors brand doesnot mean that other folks donot find it impossibly hip. Just ask the Germans. If the Japanese want to ape some of that perceived Teutonic snap, who are we to discourage them from making a vehicle with a name that stands for Coupe High Rider?"
